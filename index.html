<h1 p class ="p1">Broccoli</h1>
<p class="p2">Broccoli is the lead guitarist for The Brassicas. Being full of Vitamin C, Potassium, and
Protein, he knows how to bring good vibes, make you feel great, and pack a punch with his music. He’s also
great in a stir fry. From a young age Broccoli has been honing his skills as a guitarist and as a Brassica.
He met Cauliflower at the juice bar and respected his vision of creativity. He’s since devoted his life
to following Cauliflower’s lead to spread awareness of Brassicas and all the benefits they have to offer. </p>

<h1 p class ="p1">Cauliflower</h1>
<p class="p2">Cauliflower had a troubled childhood. Adopted into a broccolic family as a baby, he spent most
of his younger years feeling different. He was frequently mocked for his shape and texture. He found his home
in the online glitchcore community, and at 15 left home for good. Cauliflower’s sound has been described as
“disgusting”, “terrible” and “oh my sweet cherry tomato would you turn that trash off or I will come back there
myself”. In forming The Brassicas, Cauliflower hopes to share his verdant produce with the wider world.</p>

<h1 p class ="p1">Cauliflower</h1>
<p class="p2">Cabbage is a bass player from a big family of musicians in California. During her early ages of
childhood, she was exposed the famous guitarist Turnip's music. Turnip was a mentor for Cabbage until Turnip
unfortunately passed away due to farming season. Cabbage had already started playing with Cauli and Broco.
Her connection to music grew deeper,and this led their decision to move to Wales, more specifically Swansea, Wales.
The vegetable scene was particularly vibrant at that time in Swansea, Wales.</p>
