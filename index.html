<h3>Meet Father Kari</h3>
<p>Father Kari resides from deep in the forests of rural Illinois. Growing up in
a hut, she found her passion for singing when she was asked to call her many dogs
back to the house for supper. She joined the monks after her family left her
at the gas station at the age of 3. Since then, she has taken the role as back-up
to the back-up lead soprano singer, and plans on staying in that position until she dies.

    <h3>Meet Father Thomas</h3>
    <p>Father Thomas, a Malibu native, is well-renowned for his soaring soprano range and facility. He joined the group in 2017 for their Chant-pionship win at the 1252th annual Chant-off where the group chanted for record 30 hours straight. In addition to chanting, Father Thomas also enjoys a good yodel, and got his undergraduate degree in polyphonic yodeling from NYU in 2016.</p>

    <h3>Meet Father Noah</h3>
      <p>Father Noah is a native to Finland, currently residing in Rome.
      Father Noah found his calling during the 10th century
      when the pope gave a decree that gregorian chanters
      would be paid a fair living wage and given respectable royalties on all chants!
      Despite the advent of the influential politician spotifius maximus, Father Noah
      has been a strong leader at the center of equal opportunity for gregorian chanters.
      Some of father Noah's favorite hobbies are taking care of the garden at the local
      monastery, going for long walks on the tiber river, and painting natural landscapes.
