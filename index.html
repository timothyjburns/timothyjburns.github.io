<h1 p class ="p1">Broccoli</h1>
<p class="p2">Broccoli is the lead guitarist for The Brassicas. Being full of Vitamin C,<br>
Potassium, and Protein, he knows how to bring good vibes, make you feel great, and pack<br>
a punch with his music. He’s also great in a stir fry. From a young age Broccoli has been<br>
honing his skills as a guitarist and as a Brassica. He met Cauliflower at the juice bar<br>
and respected his vision of creativity. He’s since devoted his life to following Cauliflower’s<br>
lead to spread awareness of Brassicas and all the benefits they have to offer. </p>

<h1 p class ="p1">Cauliflower</h1>
<p class="p2">Cauliflower had a troubled childhood. Adopted into a broccolic family as a<br>
baby, he spent most of his younger years feeling different. He was frequently mocked for<br>
his shape and texture. He found his home in the online glitchcore community, and at 15 left<br>
home for good. Cauliflower’s sound has been described as “disgusting”, “terrible” and “oh my<br>
sweet cherry tomato would you turn that trash off or I will come back there myself”. In<br>
forming The Brassicas, Cauliflower hopes to share his verdant produce with the wider world.</p>

<h1 p class ="p1">Cabbage</h1>
<p class="p2">Cabbage is a bass player from a big family of musicians in California. During<br>
her early stages of childhood, she was exposed the famous guitarist Turnip's music. Turnip<br>
was a mentor for Cabbage until Turnip unfortunately passed away due to farming season.<br>
Cabbage had already started playing with Cauli and Broco. Her connection to music grew<br>
deeper,and this led their decision to move to Wales, more specifically Swansea, Wales.<br>
The vegetable scene was particularly vibrant at that time in Swansea, Wales.</p>
